Never Lose a Copied Link Again

ClipTrack is the clipboard history manager you've always needed. It runs in the background, saving everything you copy so you can search, find, and reuse it later.

### 🚀 Key Features
**Unlimited History**: Store text, links, and code snippets indefinitely.
**Smart Search**: Instantly find that link you copied three days ago.
**Favorites**: Pin frequently used snippets for quick access.
**Local Storage**: Your clipboard data stays 100% on your device, never in the cloud.

### 🌟 Why Choose ClipTrack?
Unlike other tools, ClipTrack is built with a focus on **user experience** and **reliability**. We believe functionality shouldn't come at the cost of browser performance or privacy.

### 🔒 Privacy Policy
We value your privacy. This extension processes data locally and adheres to strict privacy standards.
- No data sale
- No hidden tracking
