Privacy Justifications & Declarations

Single Purpose Description:
The single purpose of this extension is to rewrite and humanize AI-generated text directly within the browser sidebar, allowing users to convert robotic content into natural-sounding language without leaving their current workflow.

---------------------------------------------------

Permission Justifications:

1. storage justification:
Required to save user preferences such as the selected humanization mode (Standard, Natural, Academic), theme settings (Dark/Light), and the user's API key locally on their device. This ensures a persistent and personalized user experience across sessions.

2. sidePanel justification:
Required to display the extension's main interface in the browser's side panel. This allows users to access the humanization tools alongside their active web pages, enabling multitasking and easy copy-pasting of content.

3. declarativeNetRequest justification:
Required to modify network requests to the dedicated API endpoint (https://deceptioner.site) to ensure secure and correct communication. It allows the extension to handle API headers efficiently without needing broader host permissions.

4. Host permission justification (https://deceptioner.site/*):
Required solely to communicate with the extension's backend API (`https://deceptioner.site`) for processing text. The extension sends text input to this specific endpoint for humanization and receives the rewritten result. No other websites or user browsing data are accessed.

Remote Code:
No, I am not using Remote code.
