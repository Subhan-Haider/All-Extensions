# Privacy Policy for StudyStream

**Effective Date:** February 04, 2026

StudyStream ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We are transparent about data usage. StudyStream is designed to process data locally on your device whenever possible.

### 1.1 Local Data Storage
We use the browser's local storage API (`storage` permission) to save your preferences, settings, and temporary state. This data is stored locally on your device and is not synced to our servers unless you explicitly enable a sync feature provided by the browser (e.g., Chrome Sync).

### 1.2 Browsing Interaction
To provide the core functionality of StudyStream, the extension may interact with the websites you visit. This includes injecting scripts or reading page content to perform the requested actions. **We do not track, store, or transmit your browsing history to third-party servers.** All processing occurs locally within your browser instance.

## 2. Data Sharing and Disclosure
**We do not sell your personal data.** We do not share your information with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## 3. Data Security
We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data. Since most data resides locally on your device, it significantly limits external risks.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not automatically share data with external third-party services unless explicitly initiated by the user.

## 5. Contact Us
If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
