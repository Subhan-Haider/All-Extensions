## Security Philosophy

VaultGuard is built on the principle of **local-first security**.
- **No Cloud Storage**: Your passwords never leave your machine.
- **Encryption**: Data is stored using Chrome's secure `storage.local` API.
- **Transparency**: The codebase is open for audit at any time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within VaultGuard, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1.  Send an email to **security@vaultguard.app** (placeholder).
2.  Include a detailed description of the vulnerability.
3.  Include steps to reproduce the issue (PoC).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix if necessary.

## Best Practices

To keep your vault secure, we recommend:
1.  **Use a Primary Device**: Only install the extension on devices you own.
2.  **Browser Security**: Keep your browser updated to the latest version.
3.  **OS Security**: Ensure your operating system is secure and free of malware/keyloggers.
