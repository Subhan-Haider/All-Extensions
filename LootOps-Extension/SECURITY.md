## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security breach or vulnerability in the LootOps intel network, please decrypt your findings and report them responsibly:

1.  **Do not** publicly disclose the vulnerability until a patch has been deployed.
2.  **Open an Issue** on the GitHub repository with the tag `[SECURITY]`.
3.  Provide a detailed briefing of the exploit.

We will review the intel and deploy a hotfix as rapidly as possible.

**Thank you for keeping the vault secure.**
