# Privacy Policy for AdShield Pro

**Effective Date:** January 29, 2026

AdShield Pro is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the AdShield Pro browser extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
AdShield Pro is designed with a "Privacy First" architecture. 

*   **No Personal Data Collection:** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.
*   **No Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history or search queries.
*   **Local Storage Only:** Any information generated by the extension (such as your whitelisted sites, custom block filters, and blocking statistics) is stored **locally on your device** using the browser's storage API. 
*   **No External Transmission:** No data from your extension is ever sent to our servers or any third-party servers. All filtering logic and statistical computations happen strictly on your machine.

## 2. Permissions Justification
AdShield Pro requests specific browser permissions to function as a privacy tool:
*   **declarativeNetRequest:** To block ads and trackers at the network level.
*   **storage:** To save your local settings and whitelists.
*   **tabs/scripting:** To allow you to use the Element Picker and to refresh pages when protection is toggled.
*   **Host Permissions:** Required to provide protection across all websites you visit.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure
Because we do not collect any user data, we have no data to share, sell, or transfer to third parties. We do not use your data for advertising, lending, or any other commercial purposes.

## 4. Security
Your data stays within your browser's secure sandbox. Since no data is transmitted over the internet, your information is protected from traditional network-based security threats.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the extension and an updated `privacy.md` file.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer via the official support channels listed on the Chrome Web Store.
